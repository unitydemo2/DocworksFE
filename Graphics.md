Unity offers amazing visual fidelity, rendering power and ambience.

Make your game look just how you envisaged it with Real-time Global Illumination and our physically-based shader. From luminous day, to the gaudy glow of neon signs at night; from sunshafts, to dimly lit midnight streets and shadowy tunnels – create an evocative dynamic game to enthrall players on any platform.

This section explains all you need to know about [Lighting](LightingOverview), [Cameras](CamerasOverview), [Materials, Shaders & Textures](Shaders), [Particles](ParticleSystems) & [Visual Effects](comp-Effects), and much more.
