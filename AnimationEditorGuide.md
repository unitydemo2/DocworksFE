Animation Window Guide
=============================


The __Animation Window__ in Unity allows you to create and modify __Animation Clips__ directly inside Unity. It is designed to act as a powerful and straightforward alternative to external 3D animation programs. In addition to animating movement, the editor also allows you to animate variables of materials and components and augment your Animation Clips with __Animation Events__, functions that are called at specified points along the timeline.

See the pages about [Animation import](AnimationsImport) and [Animation Scripting](AnimationScripting) for further information about these subjects.

The rest of this section explains the different aspects of the Animation Window.
