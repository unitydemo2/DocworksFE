#Scripting

![](../uploads/Main/ScriptingIntroPic.jpg) 

Scripting is an essential ingredient in all games. Even the simplest game needs scripts, to respond to input from the player and arrange for events in the gameplay to happen when they should. Beyond that, scripts can be used to create graphical effects, control the physical behaviour of objects or even implement a custom AI system for characters in the game.

Scripting is a skill that takes some time and effort to learn. The intention of this section is not to teach you how to write script code from scratch, but rather to explain the main concepts that apply to scripting in Unity.
