Advanced Integration (SDK)
====================
Advanced Integration provides richer game data and enhances what you can see and do in the dashboard. It is not necessary in order to see basic user engagement analytics on the dashboard. [Custom Events] (http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityAnalyticsCustomEventsSDK.html), [Monetization] (http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityAnalyticsMonetizationSDK.html), and [User Attributes] (http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityAnalyticsUserAttributesSDK.html) are the building blocks for deeper analysis.
