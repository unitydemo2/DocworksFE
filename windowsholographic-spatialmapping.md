#Spatial Mapping

Windows Holographic has the capacity to construct virtual world geometry for real-world objects. This ability allows for convincing interactions between holograms and the real world. The process of mapping real-world surfaces into the virtual world is known as __Spatial Mapping__.

See the pages below for details:

* [Concept](windowsholographic-sm-concept): A detailed description of __Spatial Mapping__, citing use cases, and its limitations.
* [Low Level API](windowsholographic-sm-lowlevelapi): High level information on the low level scripting APIs.
* [Pitfalls and best practices](windowsholographic-sm-bestpractices): Guidance on common issues and ways to get around them.
* [Components](windowsholographic-sm-component): The two Spatial Mapping components allow you to quickly get up and running with mixed reality, without directly using the low-level Script Ref API.
